# Optional Final Project Details - Due 9/30/22
The final assignment for the Skill Building Workshop is to develop a Jupyter Notebook* that showcases what you have learned from this course! It is our intention that this project will provide an opportunity for you to showcase your new skills to prospective graduate advisors and employers. To help you create the notebook, we have developed a suggest set of steps to help guide you as you construct the project. We also have provided a rubric that aligns with these steps and could be used to score your notebook. 

- Pick an area of interest, plus a time frame or event(s) of interest
- Describe your motivation for selecting this area or event is of interest. Why does it matter and what do you intend to explore?
- Identify a relevant station(s) with recordings of interest or seismic sequence in an earthquake catalog and annotate the process of how and why you chose the station(s) or seismicity
- Request and download the relevant seismograms or seismicity
- Plot and analyze the seismograms or seismicity
- Consider filters, spectrograms, cross-sections, frequency-magnitude distributions, etc. and describe why you are preforming these steps.
- Generate several plots to illustrate your findings and justify the interpretations you draw from them.  
- Describe what you learned from looking at the data as well as what additional questions you have
- Finally, clean up your Jupyter notebook, provide appropriate annotation and comments to ensure someone else can follow along, and be sure that it runs as expected.

### Note that you are welcome to use tools other than Python for your project (e.g. SAC, GMT, etc.). However, we ask that you document your use of them in the Jupyter Notebook. For example, you could upload your code into a markdown window or as a pdf, and then illustrate the output as images or figures in the notebook as well

If you are struggling to get started… you can always check out the Jupyter Notebooks* that last year’s students developed.
