# localmag
An educational demonstration of calculating the local magnitude from earthquake seismic waveforms.  It provides a Jupyter notebook that uses the MassDownloader tool from ObsPy to retrieve a set of seismograms and remove the instrument response in order to estimate the local magnitude using the equation from Bullen and Bolt (1985).
