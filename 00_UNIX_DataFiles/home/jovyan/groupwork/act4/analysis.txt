Since there is likely a change in the mechanisms by which earthquakes are produced at deeper depths, the resulting magnitudes appear to be affected.
The plots suggest that earthquake producing faults are smaller at greater depths as there are less earthquakes at greater depths. 
The Earth appears to show a tendency to produce larger magnitude earthquakes at shallower depths.
